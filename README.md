# Virtual Thermostat Emulator (HIL Simulation)
![Thermostat Demo](thermostat_emulator_demo.gif)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a software simulation of a Smart Thermostat designed to demonstrate **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)** testing concepts. It consists of a WPF-based emulator that mimics physical device physics (thermal inertia, heating lag, sensor noise) and a separate "Watchdog" console application that monitors the device for critical failures.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Physics Simulation:** accurately models room temperature decay and HVAC heating curves.
* **Realistic Sensor Noise:** Implements random drift to mimic real-world sensor fluctuations using C#.
* **Automated Watchdog:** A separate process monitors the thermostat's output via file I/O and triggers an alarm if safety thresholds (>100°C) are exceeded.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Implements robust I/O handling to manage race conditions between the read/write processes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C# (.NET 8.0)
* **Frontend:** WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) / XAML
* **Architecture:** Event-Driven, Multi-Process Communication
* **Tools:** Visual Studio 2022

## ⚙️ Configuration
**Before running the simulation:**
1. Open `WatchdogScript/Program.cs`.
2. Locate the `filePath` variable.
3. Update the path to point to the `status.txt` file generated by the Emulator. 
   * *Typical Path:* `[YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT]\ThermostatEmulator\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\status.txt`

## 🏃 How to Run
1. Open `ThermostatEmulator.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click the Solution -> **Set Startup Projects**.
3. Select **Multiple Startup Projects**.
4. Set both `ThermostatEmulator` and `WatchdogScript` to **Start**.
5. Press **F5**.
